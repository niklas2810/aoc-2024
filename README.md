# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for this years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024). I already participated a few times:

- [2023](https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2023) - C# (AOT & WebAssembly)
- [2022](https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2022) - C#
- [2021](https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2021) - Python
- [2020](https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2020) - Java & C++
- [2019](https://github.com/niklas2810/aoc-2019) - Java

## My approach this year

I'm a bit late this year, starting 21st December in my holiday break. I'll won't do anything fancy, just a basic C# console application (with AOT of course). No unit tests, web app deployment or something similar :) Let's see how much of the puzzles I'll do this year!

## AI Disclaimer

Same as last year: I've been using GitHub Copilot for over a year now. I'll refrain from using some of the fancy new features (e.g. Copilot Edits/Workspace) and really solve the puzzles myself, but I really don't want to miss my god-tier autocomplete.
